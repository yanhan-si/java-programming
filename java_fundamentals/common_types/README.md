# Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning about some common class types provided by the Java API. These types provide some incredibly helpful functionality that we'll need if we are to start building professional apps. The specific types we will be covering are:

* ***Exceptions***, which help us handle errors.
* ***Enums***, which help us set variables from a list of predefined values.
* ***Dates and Calendar***, which help us store and retrieve dates.
* ***Regular Expressions (RegEx)*** which help us look for string patterns.
* ***Advanced String*** features, which will help us manipulate and process strings more efficiently.
